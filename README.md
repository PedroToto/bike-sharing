# Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon
### Project Overview

In this project, we have used the AutoGluon library to train several models for the Bike Sharing Demand competition in Kaggle. We have use Tabular Prediction to fit data from CSV files provided by the competition. This project give the ability to use AutoGluon to train several iterations of models and record your personal optimization of the problem.

Bike-sharing demand is highly relevant to related problems companies encounter, such as Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. Predicting demand not only helps businesses prepare for spikes in their services but also improves customer experience by limiting delays.
